<!-- all html documents start and end with an html tag -->
<html>

<!-- the second tag is always the head -->
<!-- it includes meta-information, such as the encoding of the page, or the title of the page (the one that appears at the top of the browser window) -->
<head>
	<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
	<meta charset="utf-8"/>

	<!-- try changing this and see that the top of your browser window does change -->
	<title>My webpage!</title>
</head>

<!-- then comes the body in which we put all the content we want the user to see -->
<body>

	<!-- this is a header tag  -->
	<h1>Hello</h1>

	<!-- this is a paragraph tag -->
	<p>
		What are you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDZcqBgCS74">looking</a> for? <!-- inside that paragraph tag we've put an anchor tag, which is essentially a hyperlink towards another webpage -->
	</p>

	<!-- this style tag allows us to write CSS -->
	<style>
	/*we start by selecting the element we want to style. here, it's p*/
	p {
		/*and then we give the attribute (e.g. the font size) and give that attribute a value (e.g. 24px)*/
		font-size: 24px;
	}

	a {
		color: deepskyblue; /* these are not made up names of colors, but rather one of the many colors established by the W3C as a standard on the web */
	}

	/*if we want to style the whole document, we can style the body element*/
	body{
		background-color: pink;
