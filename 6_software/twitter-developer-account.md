# Activate your developer account

In order to be able to write scripts that have a programmatic interaction with Twitter, you must create specific tokens which will authenticate your script to Twitter.

**If you don't have a Twitter account, you can either create one, or ask me for a spare one (I don't have enough for the class, so please use your own account if you have one).**

1. Once you've sent Pierre your twitter username, you will receive an email offering you to activate your Twitter Developer Account. Click on the link.
2. On your [Twitter Developer Dashboard](https://developer.twitter.com), click on `digital culture 2019` and click `Apps`.
3. Click `Create an app`.
4. Fill in the required fields. Here is some information you can copy and paste if you don't want to come up with your own:

**Description**

**Website URL**
https://github.com/periode/digital-culture-2019

**Sign-in with Twitter**

**Callback URL**

5. Click `Create`
6. Click on the top bar `digital culture 2019` > `Apps` > `Keys and tokens` > `Create Access Tokens`
7. You're all set! We will use these tokens in class.
