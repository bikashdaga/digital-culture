## digital inquiry

### section 1 - 9am

#### [Personalization of search results](https://enormous-holistic-bakery.glitch.me/) - isabella, paris, jessica - 16

The introduction of your inquiry is good, but is missing some references, especially when you put words such as "truth" in double-quotes—what does that mean exactly? Which sources do you base yourself on to say that filter bubbles are dangerous to politics? Your literature review and background research is thus a bit weak, since you make a lot of apparently unsubstantiated claims.

In terms of methodology, you have done a great job at thoroughly categorizing the different types of results, and cross-referencing it with the different variables extracted from the questionnaire (there's a typo on the 3. point of your analysis, though, you probably mean that if similarities were detected, that meant that the geographic location _did not_ have an impact on search results). Additionally, the sock-puppet methodology was a good choice to provide an additional control group to further test out your hypothesis.

Yet, the biggest limitation of your study is to have focused on what users have to say about their own political orientations, rather than what Google extracts from their browsing history (by going to https://adssettings.google.com). This would have been particularly relevant, as you're testing Google's interpretation of a user's profile.

#### [Disability and political engagement online](https://thoughtful-thorn-puppy.glitch.me/index.html) - leander, eleonore - 14.5

While the background research and the overall structure of the restitution of the inquiry results is clear and explicit, both from a design and research perspective, the small number of respondents already acts as a strong limitation with regards to your results and analysis.

That being said, you make a very thorough analysis of your results and could have investigated some results further: for instance, how come the two main sources of information are either completely offline or completely online? What does that correlate with? In terms of the open question, this shows how having a survey with more open questions, or offering to conduct in-depth interviews with some respondents could have shed a useful light on the quantitative results.

Finally, you could have suggested avenues for further research in your conclusion, along with your policy recommendation/commentary. One possible such would be to compare the level of media distrust in disabled populations and in non-disabled populations.

#### [Digitalization of access to culture during the pandemic](https://concise-separated-wannanosaurus.glitch.me/) - noora, maryam, nour, yasmine - 15

While the Ricoeur quote is a nice one at the beginning, you could come back to it in your conclusion to assess whether COVID-19 was, or not, such a subversive power (which doesn't seem to be so much of the case). Still, you do a great job at defining your key terms and research questions, even though you could have sourced it better, for instance by quoting from your literature review.

Your survey results are also properly contextualized, and cover the wide range of the arts by including both fine-arts museums and broader audience media like music and cinema. Qualitative interviews of two kinds of actors in the art sector (the producer and the consumer, so to speak) is also good, but it is missing an interview by a representative of the third actor (the gallerist, curator, or museum professional).

In terms of your conclusion, it would have been interesting to distinguish between accessibility and democratization: just because art is made more accessible, it does not mean that it is more democratic.

#### [Effectiveness of cookie policy at the end-user level](https://dorian-azure-saw.glitch.me/) - madeline, di, batu florian - 14

Your literature review and hypothesis formulation is well-connected and structured, and establishes clearly the rest of the study. In terms of methodology, it would have been great to actually include a copy of the survey in the methodology page!

In your analysis, you state that cookies do not offer a "simple decline button"—that's incorrect, and perhaps you could have elaborated on the role of user interfaces in influencing the behaviour of users (from the need to tick each separate cookie to the presence of a button "reject all"). Still, your findings revealing the cognitive dissonnance in users is nonetheless an important one, influenced by a misunderstanding of the GDPR, and perhaps influenced by UI decisions as well.

In your conclusion, you do point out demograpphic limitations, but you could have tempered it with a reference to the fact that your respondents are actually digital natives, and have a deeper understanding of modern communication technologies than their elders. Finally, you could have noted in your conclusion the proposed update to the EU law to make rejecting cookies as easy as accepting them: https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/gdpr-no-cookie-consent-walls/

#### [Use and mis-use of online infographics](https://infographics-final-project.glitch.me/) - henry, ava - 12

First, even though I've mentioned that you are not being graded on the design of the website, you could have made a minimal effort for the CSS of all the other pages beyond the welcome page! In terms of content, your introduction does give a good overview as to how you've gotten into the topic, but completely sidesteps any academic research on data visualization, information communication or visual design. What does the research say about it? Experts might say that, of course, infographics are biased because information delivery is always biased. Therefore, you could have narrowed down and dug further into the specificities of infographics as a medium. Indeed, your preliminary research does investigate why infographics are _good_ at presenting data, and not the opposite! Looking into Edward Tufte's work would have also confirmed the opposite of your hypothesis: that information visualization is more helpful than not.

Regarding the analysis and conclusion: first, I'm not certain what is the benefit/point of separating Ava and Henry's opinions. Second, your analysis has some shortcomings: yes, infographics are present online, and yes, people repost them without checking: is that any different from any other kind of format under which information is being distributed (e.g. clickbait headlines?). In the end, you provide your opinion on how you feel about infographics, but not an actual analysis based strictly on previous literature review and concrete findings. In conclusion, one can only estimate if a particular format is good in terms of delivering engaging information (whether good or bad) only by comparing it to other media (e.g. headlines) or by attending to its specificities (color tones, swipe-based reading, second-person address to the reader, etc.).

#### [Online interactions with influencers](https://culture-d.glitch.me/) - ecem, laura, lydie, leon - 15

Your introduction is well-written, but does make some statemnt without referencing them (is there an academic definition of an influencer? how does it differ from, say, thought-leader? did they only ever exist within the context of social media?). Especially since you do it in part 2, you could have referenced it from the beginnning.

Your inquiry is very well-written and very-well sourced, but falls short in terms of answering your initial hypothesis based on the data you've gathered. Even if such data does not exhibit clear patterns, you can still suggest further avenues for research: for instance, how come everyone follows influencers, but no one says that they are very (8-10 on the scale) influenced by them? Or what kind of connection is one that is made emotionally (through lifestyle and somewhat personal engagement) and yet easily severed when a scandal happens? By revising your methodology and including qualitative interviews, you could have developed a more nuanced understanding of what it means to be influenced.

#### [Climate change activism and carbon footprint](https://flash-feline-mouth.glitch.me/) - samanéa, kaoutar, caroline,  eliana - 15

You start from a very interesting question, but one that is nonetheless complicated to define (in terms of being productive, counterproductive, etc.). While you do good research on how social media pollutes, it would also have been interesting to further define "positive change" and "environmental awareness" in your presentation. For instance, you could have had an open question allowing respondants in your survey to qualify what they mean by "personally affecting one's own behaviour" (which you do to some extent in your question about social media campaigns, but this question itself is actually three questions bundled into one).

In your conclusion, I would be curious to know whether respondents have been affected in their climate opinion by other sources than social media: if it is not the only one, than its usefulness would decrease drastically comparatively to its harm. Otherwise, the inquiry is good and balanced in the perspectives and conclusions it offers.

### section 2 - 11am

#### [Women empowerement on Instagram](https://final-digital-culture-charlotte-ann-lilli-sania.glitch.me/) - charlotte, lilli, ann, sania - 15

Your inquiry starts without an introduction, only the old summary, so it's difficult to know whether this should be taken as the introduction, or if it's just here for reference purposes. Still, the different sections that you deduced from your combination of quantitative and qualitative information is well-articulated, and your definition work on empowerement is quite clear (in contrary to your definition of superficial which is a bit, well, superficial). The survey itself could have included short, free-form responses, in order to qualify some of the numbers that you've gotten, and connect with the longer, qualitative interviews.

Regarding those, in terms of format, it would have been better for your argumentation to integrate the quotes directly in the relevant sections (either in parentheses, as foot notes, or having your writing on the left side, and quotes on the right side). Jumping back and forth between the analysis and the quotes makes it a bit hard to folow.

Finally, as mentioned during class, it would have been interesting to see to what extent Instagram is empowering for women who do not necessarily align deeply with feminist values.

#### [Financial education online](http://ines-lionel-dc.glitch.me/) - lionel, ines - 14.5

Your hypothesis and methodology descriptions are a bit too short: first, because the former should be informed by your literature review, and second, because the latter does not exactly address whether or not financial literacy online is a niche community, and whether or not you've restricted to that niche community. Additionally, while you mention that surveys are unbiased, questions can nonetheless be very leading (even though yours often avoid that caveat, except for the question on describing markets "Risky, Important, etc.", which I've failed to see the point of).

In terms of limitations of the study, you could have pointed out at least a major one: the lack of financial background information from your respondents. While the internet democratized access to financial markets, does one still need to come from a rich family in order to invest? From the quotes that you've chosen, it would seem that yes, and this is a parameter which could affect your conclusion, in a similar way that Instagram is considered a democratizing and empowering feminist platform, but mostly for skinny white women.

#### [Trans-generational perception of online porn](https://transgenerational-perceptions-of-porn.glitch.me/) - frida, nikola, stanislaw, vasco - 13.5

While the literature review, and interview with the sexologist are a good lead-up to the formulation of the hypothesis, the hypothesis itself seems to be quite broad, general and lacking insight for a particularly interesting aspect of the problem, in the way it is formulated. Indeed, one might argue that parents have been suspicious of what their children since the 1950s—so what makes online pornography special? In which social dynamic(s) is it caught up? The conclusion you draw from the LGB internet use article offers a richer lead, involving both parents and children (overestimating porn influence vs. underestimating porn consumption).

Additionally, in terms of limitations of the study, I wonder how would have the parents' responses changed, if you had changed the phrasing from "your child" to "children of the 2000-2010 generation". There is a perhaps an implicit bias in talking about one's own child, and the results might have been different.

#### [Online unity or polarization during the pandemic](https://surf-shadowed-point.glitch.me/) - celeste, ada, gigi, nouha - 13

You highlight very well the tension between social interactions and polarizations online, but do not give a source for the concept of "false closeness". Is it yours? Who came up with it? In general, you do not mention academic research which addressed a possible definition or typologoies of closeness.

In terms of methodology, the main issue there is that you make the assumption that COVID is over. Perhaps you're referring to hard-lockdowns due to COVID, rather than to the disease itself? It is a distinction you make later on in your results, but this should have been more explicit from the beginning.

Finally, when inspecting your hypothesis of whether or not online interactions are polarizing in times of crisis, you make the mistake of asking whether an interaction with "friends" was polarizing, while I would hypothesize that most polarizing experiences happen specifically with individuals that are not considered friends. Interactions online with two distinct groups of people might lead to the closeness/polarization you'd expect.

#### [Taboos around women sexuality in the MENA region](https://the-taboo-talk.glitch.me/) - barbara, benjamin, alicia, lilinaz - 14

Your introduction is a bit short, and misses the opportunity to define key terms of your research question such as "taboo" and "sexuality" (there surely is literature on both of these terms), as well as the MENA region (what is it? why is it important to focus on this specific region? what recent changes has it gone through? the answer to these questions is implicit, but should be clearly stated). Indeed, the first step in any study is not the colleciton of data, but the survey of the current literature on the topic, which allows you to identify blind spots, on which you will then collect data.

One significant issue is that the Limitations section is still empty, and that the images for some of the form results do not load. Additonally, in terms of the interviews and analysis, it would work better if you were to integrate both (i.e. having the citations in parentheses or footnotes to justify your argumentation in your analysis).

In your conclusion, you do point out the necessity to acknowledge individual experiences in the personal process of puberty and sexual (self-)education, and also highlight that exposure to sexuality might not necessarily mean the breaking of the taboo around the topic, and you could have extended to further avenues for research by mentioning taboos that exist on social media beyond the MENA region.

#### [Role of data brokers in the data economy](https://data-distrust.glitch.me/) - leila, daniel - 16

The study is quite good, and your introduction lays out the research field and the hypothesis clearly. One caveeat is in the phrasing of your questions in the survey: it looks like you're asking leading questions in order to get your respondents to agree (known in marketing as "foot in the door" technique). You might want to start with a question such as "Which of the following do you think is a crucial component in the modern data economy?" with answers such as "Government, collecting companies, selling companies, buying companies, individuals, etc.". On the qualitative side, thought, the interviews were well-conducted and well-analyzed.

On a design note, if you apply `width: 100%` to the `.hidden-text` and each `img` elements inside in your Survey section, all images will automatically fit to the rest of the layout.

#### [Pros and cons of activism on social media](https://hip-square-coneflower.glitch.me/) - srikavya, zainab, ismaeel, eleonora - 16

Similarly to the project on the polluting side-effects of climate activism on IG, one of the key terms which you should have developed further is that of "outweighing": how can one quantify the pros and cons of a situations? Are you basing yourself on a somewhat objective, quantiattive scale, or rather on the reported perception of your interviewees?

In terms of format, you could have entered the numbers resulting from the IG polls into a spreadsheet and generated graphs, because their current presentation format makes it particularly hard to read. Similarly, the interviews could have been better formatted.

Finally, it would be interesting to propose, as an avenue for further research, to compare the perceived effectiveness of social media for activism (which you've shown), with measures of its actual effectiveness (e.g. the Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street, #MeToo or Black Lives Matter).

### section 3 - 2pm

#### [Regulation of hate-speech online](https://dc-inquiry.glitch.me/) - francesca, alberto, colombe, lorenzo - 15,5

Your introduction is clear, and well-defined, along with the methodology, of which the caveats are clearly acknowledged. In terms of survey results, displaying question #8 as a bar graph doesn't work so well, and should have been addresses the same way you analyze questions #13 and #15.

In terms of the interviews, completing with qualitative data is a good call, but you could have (1) described briefly who is the interviewee and (2) only select the most important quotes in the sound file in your analysis, and keep the whole file in the bibliography/appendix. The way you organized your analysis, weaving in literature review and survey responses, is particularly relevant.

In conclusion, you do mention the supranational implications, and could have developed a bit more on this topic to provide further avenues for research.

#### [Identity politics on social media](https://excited-daily-drum.glitch.me/inquiry.html) - zineb, bianca, maryam, clarissa - 15

The grounds of your study are very well established, and your methodology is very clearly laid out, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. In practice, the phenomenon you noted the of respondents answering less the questions the further they were in the IG story, and it would have been good to anticipate it by ordering the questions by importance, or by time of response expected (e.g. starting with the easiest, and leading to longer questions).

Your analysis of your interviewees is also good, particularly your interpretation of the position of the "free thinkers"; but the biggest caveat to your study is that you do not specify their social background: are they political science students? If yes, how would that possibly skew the representativeness of political identities; it would have been productive to consciously overcome these limitations by choosing individuals who might not be engaged with politics outside of social media.

#### [Dating apps and mental health during Covid lockdown](http://pandemic-dating.glitch.me/) - viktoria, marcus, salim - 15

While your study is supported by extensive data collection and literature review, perhaps the central point of "relief" is the one that is least addressed: while you mention in your conclusion that the study is inconclusive, it seems that you've nonetheless found a relationship between at least the loneliness level of users and the self-reporting of why they used SBDA (curiosity and boredom). You could have also narrowed down your analysis to the respondents who explicitly said they were using ODAs.

This means you could have extended the questionnaire to ask about other possible means to relieve loneliness during the Covid lockdown, which could have contextualized further the use of SWBDA.

---

#### [How influencing are influencers across generations?](http://how-influential.glitch.me/) - lucille, melisa - 17

Your introduction and establishment of your hypothesis is very well done, by explicitly specifying the literature review and definitions that you base it on.

Combining quantitative and qualitative also allowed you to elaborate a more holistic overview, especially with the interview of a marketing department employee. Yet, while the age group distribution of your respondents might not help in answering your question about the generation gap, you nonetheless found interesting answers that relate directly to your hypothesis.

Finally, it would have been interesting to contextualize this purchase behaviour by including in your survey how, in general, someone purchases new goods or services, to have an idea of where the position of the influencer stands in respect to other marketing channels (TV, online reviews, personal recommendation, own research, etc.)
