Freedom can be associated either to immediate restraints, or to subsequent consequences. The &quot;spontaneous&quot; and &quot;worldwide&quot; development (or so it seemed) of the internet made the early users feel that there was some ineluctability to the spread of communication, knowledge and information, as illustrated by the motto &quot;information wants to be free&quot;.

The other component is anonymity. At some point, it was impossible to know who was saying what, and instead of a terrifying nightmare of potential terrorist activity that this would be seen as in the 21st century, this was considered an opportunity to erase all inequalities: race, gender, income, etc. Whenever you're online, the only thing that matters is what you know, and what you say.</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">electronic frontier foundation</h3><div class="prep note" concept="1">can a cyberspace be independent?</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1">The first appearance of the term cyberspace is in William Gibson's sci-fi novel Neuromancer, which had a huge impact on pop culture then, and now (e.g. The Matrix was heavily influenced by the style and world of Neuromancer). In this novel, groups of self-organized individuals, hackers, travel in a digital (yet, three-dimensional) world in order to fight against the oppression of corporations. Cyberspace, then, is first and foremost a fantasy. But this fantasy has roots in deeper, broader dreams: the New Frontier, the communes of the 1960s and early libertarian thinking.

ThIndependent from what? For Barlow, it's obviously being independent from nation-states, but as we have seen last week, there are different forces at play when it comes to the development of technology: governments are one of them, along with the military and commerce, but there are also two others: academica, and us. This class is going to specifically address the influence of academia on the development of the internet.

Without code, in the cyberspace, there is nothing; no jurisprudence, only decrees.

The question, then, is not whether or not we can be independent from external forces in cyberspace, but rather how do we actually hold accountable the forces that do.</div></div></div><br><div class="break-after" style="page-break-after:always;"></div><div class="concept-group"><h3 class="concept-name" id="internet history">internet history</h3><div class="context">first mention of the word internet: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc675

It might seem a stretch, but the picture above illustrates quite clearly the influence of knowledge on power and agency.

The same way that lack of information about reproductive health maintains a system of control on those who cannot understand and act upon their own bodies, a lack of knowledge about technical systems makes us more vulnerable to its pitfalls.</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">a stack of protocols</h3><div class="prep note" concept="3">tcp/ip -&gt; addresses (machine version)</div><div class="prep note" concept="3">dns -&gt; addresses (human version)</div><div class="prep note" concept="3">http/smtp/ftp/irc -&gt; itinerary</div><div class="prep note" concept="3">html -&gt; display instructions</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="3">The global network has multiple layers. The first one, not mentioned above, is the link layer. The link layer is the set of physical infrastructures which underpin everything else. Aka cables. Those cables are particulary vulnerable to two things: sharks and the NSA.

Then comes IP (where do I go), then TCP (do I still make sense when I'm there), then everything else (what is it that i was trying to say in the first place).

This layer scheme is quite recurrent in digital technology, which often consists on layers of abstractions relying on top of each other.</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">tcp/ip</h3><div class="prep note" concept="3">transmission control protocol</div><div class="prep note" concept="3">how do we make sure that whatever we're sending gets there in one piece?</div><div class="prep note" concept="3">internet protocol</div><div class="prep note" concept="3">how do i know where i'm going, and how to get there?</div><div class="prep note" concept="3"><img src="digital-culture-2019_assets/birthplaque.jpg" alt="birthplaque.jpg"></div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="3">IP (Internet Protocol) is the set of behaviours which allows to know where a computer is on a network. It is essentially an address system along with a network of roads. In an example of going from A to B, it first defines what it means to be A, and to be B (i.e. it assigns addresses, of the type 127.234.231.9), and then it establishes multiple paths between A and B, by breaking up a given message from A to B and having different parts of that message go through different paths to get to their destination.

The job of TCP, then, is to make sure that, once those packets have gotten to B, none of them are missing, and they can be reliably re-assembled in order to make sense of that message. It does so by structuring the data in a very particular way (see resources for a detailed explanation).

Those two protocols were designed by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn at UCLA in 1967, and the first packet sent according to these protocols was sent on October 29, 1969. Their message actually crashed the whole network. In contrast, the first message ever sent via the telegram was &quot;What Hath God Wrought?&quot; -quite visionary for the time.</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">dns</h3><div class="prep note" concept="3">domain name system</div><div class="prep note" concept="3">how the hell am i supposed to remember all these numbers?</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="3">Because IP addresses are just numbers, the DNS protocol convert these numbers in human-memorable means: words, separated by dots.

the W3Schools website, very good for beginners and entry level.

https://w3schools.com

the MDN (mozilla developer network) website, a little more elaborate.

https://developer.mozilla.org</div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">html</h3><div class="prep note" concept="5">hyper text markup language</div><div class="prep note" concept="5">a markup language is a language which describes __what__ the content is</div><div class="prep note" concept="5">&lt;tagname attribute=&quot;value&quot;&gt; innerText &lt;/tagname&gt;</div><div class="prep note" concept="5">&lt;p class=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt; Lorem ipsum dolores sit amet... &lt;/p&gt;</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="5">HTML is essentially a set of tags, which the browser uses to render the document appropriately. For example, a &lt;p&gt; tag describes a paragraph, so the browser will add a bit of white space at the bottom of that block. Because tags denote blocks, they need to be __opened__ and __closed__. Closing a tag is as simple as including a forward slash ( / ) before the tag:

&lt;p&gt; lorem &lt;/p&gt;

An &lt;a&gt; tag describes an anchor, i.e. a web link, and needs an __attribute__ to function properly. Attributes are specific features of tags, which can vary from tag to tag. We might want all the &lt;p&gt; tags on a page to behave the same, but probably not all the &lt;a&gt; tags to send us to the same link. For that, we give a __value__ to the __attribute__ of the tag. The name is the attribute which takes care of where the &lt;a&gt; will link to is called href:

&lt;a href=&quot;http://wikipedia.org&quot;&gt;click here to go to wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;

A last attribute which we will introduce is the __class__ attribute. This attribute allows us to connect the HTML to the CSS. In other words, it allows us to connect WHAT things are (a paragraph, a link, a title), with HOW they should look (bold, big, justified, etc.).</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">css</h3><div class="prep note" concept="5">cascading style sheets</div><div class="prep note" concept="5">a style sheet is a document which indicates __how__ things should look</div><div class="prep note" concept="5">selector { attribute: value }</div><div class="prep note" concept="5">p { color: green }</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="5">CSS is a set of instructions which comes with an HTML file. We can integrate CSS in multiple ways to the HTML document, either through inline CSS (adding a __style=&quot;&quot;__ attribute directly inside the tag), having its own &lt;style&gt; tag in the HTML file, or having it all in a separate file, and telling the HTML document where to find that file.

But in the end, CSS always does the same thing: it states how a particular HTML tag should look like. This can include fonts, colors, animations, positioning, etc.

It does that by having a __selector__, which is followed by curly brackets, within which each __attribute__ is given a __value__. After each value, you must tell the browser that you're done by adding a semi-colon ( ; ).

For example, making a title red and underlined would look like this:

h1 {
  color: red;
  text-decoration: underline;
