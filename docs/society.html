</div><div class="context-links"></div><hr></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">main questions</h3><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>how do we socialize online?</p>
<p>how do we create and consume culture online?</p>
<p>how do we organize politically online? how are we organized online politically?</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>The main question of this week is: how do some aspects of human behavior translate online? How do different ways information flows affect what we can do and say online, and what we can do and say offline? Which behaviors change, and which remain the same?</p>
<p>The first lens we will look through is how we&#39;ve translated social performance. What were the first forms of sociability on the internet, and how did these forms of sociability evolve to form the landscape of &#39;social media&#39; as we see it today? We&#39;ll move through history from hackers to participative web to monolithic social networks.</p>
<p>The second lens will be that of content creation. How did the models of culture creation and consumption evolve, and how did they differ from previous eras in which different media were the dominant form of sharing? We&#39;ll look at remixing culture, free software and open source movements, as well as copyright concerns.</p>
<p>Finally, the last lens will be that of the more classical understanding of political organization, with a particular focus on how digital technologies allow for the emergence of new forms of power structures, and how they reinforce existing means of control.</p>

<p>the two meanings of &quot;free&quot;</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>The term hacking originally means &quot;figuring out one&#39;s own way to do something&quot;, and often implies doing something that was not originally expected. The first &quot;technological&quot; hackers were people tapping into phone lines, and managing to get calls for free, but the practice itself predates digital technology, and can be assimilated to what has bee called &quot;poaching&quot;.</p>
<p>Michel De Certeau, in his influential book &quot;The Practice of Everyday Life&quot; (L&#39;Invention du Quotidien), defines poaching as the <strong>tactics</strong> that are put into place and enacted by receivers/consumers/users in the face of the <strong>strategies</strong> that are established by creators/producers/institutions.</p>
<p>Hacking is then first and foremost a cultural practice, and our modern understanding of hacking has been influenced by (1) the lack of understanding of the greater public as to what is actually going on when people &quot;hack&quot;  and (2) the loss of economic profit from corporations, and the loss of control from governments as a result of the actions of hackers. There exists multiple kinds of hackers in mainstream culture today: &quot;white-hat&quot; hackers, &quot;black-hat&quot; hackers, but neither of these actually represent accurately what hacker culture was at the beginning.</p>
<p>The two main ways that we can understand the word &quot;free&quot; in either &quot;no cost&quot; or &quot;no restriction&quot;.</p>
<p>Open-source and free software are closely related. Software started as being by default open-source, since it was shared and distributed amongst a close networks of academics and researchers. It&#39;s only when it became expensive to write software (relatively to the cost of hardware) that it made economic sense to make software a kind of intellectual property, particularly under the influence of early companies such as IBM, Microsoft and Apple whose business model depended on exclusive rights to use and distribute software. Bill Gates particularly stood up against the common practices at the time which consisted in sharing source code in order to share software. By the end of the 70s, the copyright rules had caught up and proprietary software was the norm.</p>
<p>In response to that, a group of academics started the GNU project, which consisted in providing open-source software which could also be re-used in whatever way the user saw fit.</p>
<p>We will talk more about the implications of open-source in economic terms; the important point for now is that there is a pervasive belief within hackers, and within those who associate with the hacker movement, that more information is always better, that access to knowledge should be unlimited and unregulated, and that one should be judged a posteriori, by its results, rather than a priori.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">information wants to be free</h3><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>from bulletin board systems to the web 2.0</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"><div class="prep note" concept="2">user</div></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>These social practices of hacker culture and the associated ethos of closed-source/open-source, proprietary/free software, are closely intertwined with the the means of communication, whether how they created these cultures, and how these cultures created them.</p>
<p>One the one side, you have things like the early communication systems: SSH, BBS, Usenet, IRC, etc. These were designed to allow for interaction between the participants (except for SSH, which allowed multiple people to use the same machine at the same time), and followed the design of a public message board, or a public chat. It took the web sometime to integrate these models of communication to its architecture (the web was originally made to serve static, non-interactable content). The switch towards a more user-friendly web (one with comments, wikis, blog posts, etc.) has led to what is called the <strong>Web 2.0</strong>.</p>
<p>On the other side, the hacker ethos transpired into some of the largest commercial digital products of our times. Products like MySpace, Facebook, AirBnB or Uber stand in the direct tradition of &quot;hacking&quot;, and most companies and institutions now organize &quot;hackathons&quot;, associating the practice with a sort of brainstorming. The terms disruption, hack, break, find their roots in these communities.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">the participative web</h3><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>from construction to contribution: user-generated content</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"><div class="prep note" concept="2">rrrrr</div></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>Hackers and the hacker ethos laid out the foundation for new and complex phenomena: the participative web, and social media. The switch to the Web 2.0 is then a switch in scale and usability. It becomes easier to edit things live, to set-up complex systems like a blog or a personal page, and to interact with webpages in ways that were either new or previously restricted to non-web systems (e.g. google maps, google drive, etc.). The Web 2.0 became emblematic by the platforms that appeared: MySpace, Wikipedia, YouTube, Facebook et. al.). Anyone can now theoretically say anything to anyone else. Information is free.</p>
<p>One of the first manifestations of these new possibilities is the creation of cultural groups online. With the streamlining of information sharing, and the reduction of friction in user interfaces and user experiences, sub-cultures started to develop (around Second Life, MySpace, Tumblr, etc.), around shared tastes, interests and activities. Exclusively-online cultures, such as MUDs (Multi-User Dungeon), which have been around as early as the 80s are now a possibility, and individuals are no longer restricted by lack of access or geographic remoteness.</p>
<p>This abundance of access has another consequence. It is no longer necessary to ask permission from traditional content-producers (e.g. newspapers) in order to publish and discuss something. Social media (like IndyMedia, Ohmynews, Rue89) were set-up in order to bypass the censorship and barrier to entry in existing dominant media. The result of this lack of moderation isn&#39;t always the magical appearance of high-quality content, but rather a complicated intertwining of broad tendencies, existing cultural agendas and economic incentives.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">social media</h3><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>the massification of the participative web is social media</p>
<p>we moved away from social networks for producers towards social networks for consumers</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>Once all of these technologies are in place, we get what we call &quot;social media&quot;. The difference here is that these platforms offer an alternative which switches the focus to the real, identifiable self, and away from the completely fictional personas.</p>
<p>While previous systems (BBS, UseNet, IRC, Wikipedia) are also social networks, the ones we understand by &quot;social network&quot; today are definitely ones that relate to who we are &quot;officially&quot;. For example, Facebook and Google are two platforms that have enforced real name policies, and multiple others allow users to be &quot;verified&quot;, by establishing a proof of who they are offline, and online.</p>
<p>A social network is therefore a platform in which every user has a personal page, and can interact with other users&#39; personal pages. It is the massification of blogging (doing), combined with the richness of identity building (being).</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">social postures online</h3><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>our identities online lie between:</p>
<ul>
<li>doing and being</li>
<li>fictional and real</li>
</ul>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>Dominique Cardon has a visual matrix (see context) which maps out the different types of behaviors that can be associated with different locations (platforms). This matrix runs along a DOING &lt;&gt; BEING axis, where doing implies more active contribution and creation of original content, while being implies only (more or less) strategic display of information.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">societies and infrastructure</h3><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>different infrastructures can facilitate different cultures</p>
<p>the ideals of earlier sociabilities online still inform the discussions today, even though they might not be the most dominant anymore</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>The development of digital platforms helped create three groups of people which overlapped to significant extents: producers, hackers and consumers. The producers functioned in the very early days in a mode of REAL DOING, that is, their real identities were linked to their actions, which usually resulted in copying, creating or receiving software.</p>
<p>As software became commercialized, and as the difference between (known) professionals and (unknown) amateurs became more clear, hackers started acting within the FICTIONAL DOING, where real identity didn&#39;t matter as much. The founder of the Free Software movement, Richard Stallman, was known online by his acronym (RMS) than by his full name.</p>
<p>Hackers and commercial producers then developed a first version of tools which were used for more and more FICTIONAL BEING, along with FICTIONAL DOING. These included blogs, wikis, personal pages and profiles, as well as online game-worlds.</p>
<p>Finally, with the advent of commercial, holistic social media, the tendency pushes even further towards REAL BEING. This doesn&#39;t mean that we are all exposed fully all the time, but rather that we acknoweldge that it is no longer the point to project completely fictional personas. Still, if the anonymous actions at some stage of the internet are no longer the reality of the situation, they remain a large inspiration for the internet was and could still be.</p>

</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="3"><p>The internet has enabled forms of self-regulation for online-specific projects. The two most significant ones are Wikipedia and Linux. Wikipedia is structured around low-level self-regulation (editors regulate each other without direct intervention of higher echelons of the hierarchy). The editors comment, refute and approve each other&#39;s contributions which enables the emergence of quality content. Linux, on the other hand, is developed in a strict vertical fashion. While anyone can theoretically contribute to the kernel (the core of the Linux ecosystem), it is up to the creator, Linus Torvalds, to ultimately approve or deny the final integration of the contribution in the kernel. Both of these forms of organization are based around the idea of contribution: it is what you add to the commons that is the only criteria for judgment.</p>
<p>Another form of political organization is the one that integrates with existing structures (e.g. local or state governments). The improved means of communication through digital channels allow us to re-imagine the idea of direct democracy. Each one can theoretically directly contribute to the public debate.</p>
<p>As J.R. Licklider put it: “The political process would essentially be a giant teleconference, and a campaign would be a months-long series of communications among candidates, propagandists, commentators, political action groups, and voters. The key is the self-motivating exhilaration that accompanies truly effective interaction with information through a good console and a good network to a good computer.”</p>
