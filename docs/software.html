It is what we call a <strong>sociotechnical object</strong>, an object which reaches from, and back into, both society and technics.</p>

</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>Software is a set of instructions that can be executed at any scale, and that can calculate anything that can be calculated. Software is both everything and nothing. It is like speech: powerful, but ephemeral, ordering the doing, both subduing and subdued by action.</p>
<p>Software is abstraction. It is a series of operations that can operate on any numerical formula.</p>
<p>Software is the moment when the human interfaces with the (computing) machine, before the machine interfaces back with the world. Software is the language of the digital and, in order to understand the digital, we must understand software.</p>
<p>However, software is also human-made, with its messiness appearing whenever it is confronted with the analog nature of real life.</p>

<p>charles babbage (proto-computer), ada lovelace (first programmer), alan turing (theoretical computer), claude shannon (information theory), john von neumann (practical computer), grace hopper (professional programmer and navy admiral)</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>The first computers did not have any software with them. Software is what tells the hardware how it should behave, and the first computers were not <em>programmable</em> computers, they couldn&#39;t be reprogrammed without being actually <em>physically rewired</em>. The software, then, the process of rewiring a computer, was the responsibility of the computer, the female secretaries and clerks which followed the orders of the male mathematicians and scientists to implement the algorithms they wanted to calculate. It was considered at the time that &quot;proper&quot; computer science was to be done as far away from the computer as possible, since it was &quot;a girl&#39;s job&quot;.</p>
<p>This early form of <strong>command and control</strong> architecture, in which we tell the computer to execute some tasks, comes from another existing form of control, that of power relationships between gender. It is only when software became more interesting than hardware (i.e., when software could be run on more than a handful of computers) that programming gained in popularity and that the involvement of women dropped drastically.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">programming languages</h3><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>&quot;the limits of my language mean the limits of my world&quot; -ludwig wittgenstein</p>
<p>programming languages evolve over time (functional -&gt; object oriented)</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>The development of programming languages follows the attempts of humans to communicate clearly to the machine what they have in mind. Alan Turing, when he theorized his Universal Computer, stated that it could do anything that was computable. The total sum of what was computable wasn&#39;t just math (i.e. missile trajectories, radar detection, etc.), but also people.</p>
<p>In parallel to the development of mathematics for military purposes (e.g. cryptography), a new political paradigm appeared: that of counting populations to control them. An example of that is the role that IBM played in the US Census of 1890 (or rather, the founder of the company went on creating IBM once he invented a punch card system for the said Census), but also the role that IBM played in Nazi Germany, when the company provided the infrastructure to count Germans, including Jews, Gipsies and other undesired ethnic groups. Such developments still continue in 2019, in India and Myanmar, where marginalized populations are excluded through the sole process of counting.</p>
<p>These two dynamics were finalized during <strong>the shift between functional programming towards object-oriented programming</strong>. Essentially, this meant that one no longer needed to deal exclusively with building blocks such as <code>integers</code>, <code>floating point numbers</code>, <code>booleans</code> or <code>characters</code>, but could instead create their own building blocks. For an instance, a building block could be a <code>User</code> or <code>Client</code> or <code>Terrorist</code>. Object-Oriented Programming allowed us to start describing the world in computer terms, and treat it like a computable object.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">the language of new media</h3><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>what makes computer-based media different from existing media?</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>The two key works here are <em>Understanding Media</em>, by Marshall McLuhan, and <em>The Language of New Media</em>, by Lev Manovich. McLuhan who founded the field of media studies, and offered an understanding of <strong>media as extensions of ourselves</strong> and of <strong>media as more important than messages</strong>. Now that the attention of some scholars had been directed to the specificty of media as relevant objects of study, Manovich theorized the unique specificities of new media, which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>numerical representation <em>everything can be a number</em></li>
<li>modularity <em>a system can be broken into smaller parts and replaced in different places, physical integrity is no longer a problem</em></li>
<li>automation <em>a set of rules can act on their own</em></li>
<li>variability <em>new media is customizable</em></li>
<li>transcoding <em>through numerical representation, data can be coded in different ways: e.g. data visualization</em></li>
</ul>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">the word and the image</h3><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>our interaction implies interfaces, and rules of engagement (<strong>procedural rhetoric</strong>)</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>Our interactions with software are both mental, and physical. For now, we will just focus on the physical part.</p>
<p>Software, to us, is a something that reacts to, and triggers, buttons, switches, toggles, sliders, screens, LEDs, infra-red lights, etc. These are called <em>sensors</em> (when it&#39;s an input, like your keyboard) and <em>actuators</em> (when it&#39;s an output, like your screen). These are interfaces, and interfaces can be tricky things, because they both make visible and make invisible, because they do not want to overwhelm you with choices. By showing what can be done, they can create a potential &quot;stage&quot;, an environment in which an individual becomes a user. Indeed, while PCs and Macs are essentially the same machine (both based on the same Von Neumann, and sometimes even the same Intel processor), their interfaces make us feel like they couldn&#39;t be more different from one another, and even go as far as to differentiate socially their users.</p>
<p>More importantly, interfaces (or at least good interfaces) disappear, become obvious and <em>natural</em>; if we don&#39;t think about the action we are doing because if feels <em>right</em>, how can we critically examine the social construction of that action?</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">software and mind</h3><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>cybernetics (control and communications in the animal and the machine)</p>
<p>&quot;to live effectively is to live with adequate information. thus communication and control belong to the essence of [hu]man&#39;s inner life, even as they belong to their life in society&quot; -norbert wiener</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>And so this is the question. If the physical world can be computed, to what extent can the psychological world be computed?</p>
<p>Variability reinforces customization and individuality. Transcoding condenses further the media landscape (more text, more images, more sounds, etc.). Modularity reinforces universality.</p>
<p>Cybernetics are based on <strong>(1)</strong> a universal intellectual system and <strong>(2)</strong> a way to quantify change and evolution within that system. The point is to measure and modulate communications in order to steer the system into a particular state. The systems we&#39;re talking about here are physics, biology, societies, etc.</p>
<p>This connection between biology and computer science prefigured neural networks that we see today, and makes the human mind exist within the realm of effective computability.</p>
<p>And yet, there is still the problem of embodiment: all of this needs to happen <em>within a medium</em> and that medium is always imperfect.</p>

<p>The approach of the problem was no longer to pre-establish a system of rules which could determine any outcome, but rather to present the outcome to the system and let it determine its own rules. Such an approach, like the Perceptron, invented in 1958, mimicked the human brain by connecting individual neurons to each other, and using the distributed power of these neurons for a single, binary output (i.e. determine whether a statement is true or not).</p>
<p>The second change is based both on hardware and on people. Hardware has been following Moore&#39;s law, which states that computing power doubles every other year for the same price.</p>
